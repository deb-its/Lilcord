## Why Lilcord is better for your PC:
1. Less RAM Usage ðŸŽŸ
2. Less Storage Needed ðŸ’¾ **(83.33% SMALLER THAN DISCORD)**

## How is Lilcord so lightweight:
Lilcord uses "pywebview", a lightweight package for creating desktop gui's with webview.
> pywebview is basically electron but without the bloat.

### Building
Install the necessary libraries:
```cmd
pip install pywebview
```

Copy the git:
```git
git clone https://github.com/deb-its/Lilcord.git
```

Open `src/app.py` and you can modify it there! (Don't worry there are comments to help you.)
